### Phase 4: Field Dependency Value Comparison (0% Complete)

**Goal**: Enhance dependency comparison to compare the actual controlling and dependent picklist values, not just the existence of dependencies

**Current Limitation:**
- Org Compare currently shows whether dependencies exist in source/target orgs
- Does not compare the actual dependency mapping (which controlling values map to which dependent values)
- Cannot detect drift in dependency configurations

**Implementation Summary:**
- [ ] Update [background/org-compare-api.js](background/org-compare-api.js)
  - Enhance `getDependencies()` method to retrieve full dependency mappings
  - Add `getDependencyValues()` method to extract controlling → dependent value mappings
  - Add comparison logic to match dependency rules between orgs
  - Parse and structure `validFor` bitfield data from Salesforce API

- [ ] Update [org-compare/org-compare.js](org-compare/org-compare.js)
  - Update `createComparisonItem()` to display dependency value mappings
  - Show controlling values and their associated dependent values
  - Highlight differences in value mappings (e.g., controlling value "A" maps to different dependent values in each org)
  - Add expandable/collapsible view for complex dependency chains

- [ ] Update [org-compare/org-compare.css](org-compare/org-compare.css)
  - Add styles for dependency value mapping display
  - Add visual indicators for value mapping differences
  - Full dark mode support

**Key Features:**
- [ ] Compare controlling picklist values between orgs
- [ ] Compare dependent picklist values and their mappings
- [ ] Detect differences in dependency mappings:
  - [ ] Controlling values that exist in one org but not the other
  - [ ] Dependent values that exist in one org but not the other
  - [ ] Different mappings (same controlling value maps to different dependent values)
- [ ] Visual representation of dependency chains
- [ ] Expandable view showing full value mappings
- [ ] Status indicators for each mapping:
  - Match: Same controlling value maps to same dependent values in both orgs
  - Different: Same controlling value maps to different dependent values
  - Source Only: Mapping exists in source org only
  - Target Only: Mapping exists in target org only

**Technical Implementation:**

**Data Structure:**
```javascript
// Dependency comparison item structure
{
  key: "Account.Industry → Type",
  status: "different", // match, different, sourceOnly, targetOnly
  sourceValues: {
    controllingField: "Industry",
    dependentField: "Type",
    mappings: [
      {
        controllingValue: "Technology",
        dependentValues: ["Enterprise", "SMB", "Startup"]
      },
      {
        controllingValue: "Finance",
        dependentValues: ["Banking", "Insurance", "Investment"]
      }
    ]
  },
  targetValues: {
    controllingField: "Industry",
    dependentField: "Type",
    mappings: [
      {
        controllingValue: "Technology",
        dependentValues: ["Enterprise", "Startup"] // Missing "SMB" - difference!
      },
      {
        controllingValue: "Finance",
        dependentValues: ["Banking", "Insurance", "Investment"]
      }
    ]
  },
  differences: [
    "Technology mapping differs: source has 3 values, target has 2",
    "Target missing dependent value: SMB"
  ]
}
```

**API Integration:**
- Use Salesforce REST API `/services/data/v59.0/sobjects/{object}/describe`
- Parse `pickllistValues[].validFor` property (base64-encoded bitfield)
- Decode bitfield to determine which controlling values enable which dependent values
- Build mapping matrix for comparison

**Comparison Algorithm:**
1. Retrieve all field dependencies for selected object(s)
2. For each dependency, fetch controlling and dependent picklist values
3. Parse validFor bitfield to build value mapping matrix
4. Compare mappings between source and target orgs
5. Identify differences at the value mapping level
6. Generate comparison results with detailed differences

**Display Format:**
```
Industry → Type [Different]

  Controlling: Technology
    Source: Enterprise, SMB, Startup (3 values)
    Target: Enterprise, Startup (2 values)
    Difference: Missing "SMB" in target

  Controlling: Finance
    Source: Banking, Insurance, Investment (3 values)
    Target: Banking, Insurance, Investment (3 values)
    Status: Match ✓
```

**Status**: Not Started

  - Filter by action (create, update, delete)
  - Filter by status (success, failure)
  - Filter by date range (from/to)
  - Search by component name, object, or org
- ✅ Statistics dashboard showing:
  - Total deployments
  - Successful vs failed count
  - Recent activity (last 7 days)
- ✅ Deployment details modal showing:
  - Timestamp, deployment ID, org details
  - Metadata type, action, component name
  - Before/after change details (JSON diff)
  - Error messages for failed deployments
  - Salesforce deployment ID (if available)
- ✅ Two view modes:
  - List view - Table with sortable columns
  - Timeline view - Chronological grouped by date
- ✅ Export to CSV/JSON
- ✅ Delete individual deployment records
- ✅ Clear all history with confirmation
- ✅ Full dark mode support

**Storage Strategy:**
- Uses chrome.storage.local for deployment history
- Retention policy: Keep last 1000 deployments OR 6 months (whichever is less)
- Stored as structured JSON array
- Indexed by timestamp for fast retrieval
- Automatic cleanup on new deployments

**Data Structure:**
```javascript
{
  id: "dep_1732291200000_abc123", // Unique ID
  timestamp: "2025-11-22T10:30:00Z",
  orgUrl: "https://mydomain.my.salesforce.com",
  orgId: "00D...",
  orgName: "My Org",
  userId: "005...",
  metadataType: "ValidationRule",
  action: "update", // create, update, delete
  objectName: "Account",
  componentName: "My_Validation_Rule",
  changeDetails: {
    before: { /* metadata before */ },
    after: { /* metadata after */ }
  },
  status: "success", // success, failure
  deploymentId: "0Af...", // Salesforce deployment ID
  errorMessage: null,
  source: "extension" // extension, manual, api
}
```

**Status**: Complete

### Phase 6: Delta-Based Metadata Deployment (0% Complete) 🔒

**Goal**: Deploy only the differences (delta) between source and target metadata

**Security**: This feature will be password-protected like Dependency Loader

**Planned Implementation:**
- [ ] Create [background/delta-deployment-api.js](background/delta-deployment-api.js)
  - Add `calculateDelta()` - Compare source vs target metadata
  - Add `buildDeltaPackage()` - Generate deployment package with only changes
  - Add `validateDelta()` - Pre-deployment validation
  - Add `deployDelta()` - Execute delta deployment via Metadata API
  - Add `previewDelta()` - Show what will be deployed

- [ ] Create [pages/delta-deploy/](pages/delta-deploy/) directory
  - Add `delta-deploy.html` - Main UI
  - Add `delta-deploy.js` - UI logic with password protection
  - Add `delta-deploy.css` - Styling

- [ ] Update [background/service-worker.js](background/service-worker.js)
  - Add message handlers for delta deployment
  - Integrate with deployment history logging

- [ ] Update [popup/index.html](popup/index.html) and [popup/app.js](popup/app.js)
  - Add "Delta Deployment" button with lock icon
  - Implement password protection (unlock key: TBD)

**Key Features:**
- [ ] Compare metadata between source and target orgs
- [ ] Calculate delta (additions, modifications, deletions)
- [ ] Preview changes before deployment
- [ ] Support for multiple metadata types:
  - [ ] Permissions (Profiles, Permission Sets)
  - [ ] Fields (Custom Fields)
  - [ ] Validation Rules
  - [ ] Flows
  - [ ] Picklists
  - [ ] Dependencies
  - [ ] Other metadata types
- [ ] Delta deployment package generation
- [ ] Deploy only changed components
- [ ] Deployment validation and error handling
- [ ] Integration with Deployment History
- [ ] Rollback capability
- [ ] Password protection (experimental feature warning)
- [ ] Full dark mode support

**Delta Calculation Logic:**
- **Additions**: Components in source but not in target
- **Modifications**: Components in both but with different values
- **Deletions**: Components in target but not in source (handle carefully)

**Deployment Strategy:**
- Generate minimal package.xml with only changed components
- Build deployment ZIP with delta metadata only
- Use Metadata API deploy() with checkOnly=true for validation
- Execute actual deployment after user confirmation
- Log all deployments to Deployment History

**Security Considerations:**
- Require unlock key for access (similar to Dependency Loader)
- Display warning message about experimental feature
- Require explicit user confirmation before deployment
- Provide detailed preview of all changes
- Implement validation checks before deployment
- Test in sandbox environments first

**Technical Approach:**
- Use existing Org Compare API as foundation
- Extend comparison logic to generate deployment packages
- Reuse Metadata API integration from existing features
- Implement JSON/XML diff algorithm for metadata comparison
- Use JSZip for package generation

**Status**: Not Started
